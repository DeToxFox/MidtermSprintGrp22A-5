# MidtermSprintGrp22A-5
This Keyin's Semester 1 Group 22A-5 Midterm Sprint Week repository, for Project 1 the NL Chocolate Company Travel Claims Processing System.

The official submittal for Project 1 is Grp22A-5 SprintProjct 1.py, this file was used to compile everyones code once they completed and is currently up to date.

Project 2 (Trello) is listed as SprintWeek Project 2 David Turner and is a word document.

DTfunction.py was my working file for the Option 1 - Enter an Employee Travel Claim function and also the "Other" function which is a calculation based function for finding the differnce between 2 dates a user would input and returning it as an int and reference in the code as number of days.

Other files such as MainMenuWokInProgess.py and MainWithCalcFunction.py were testing based files for errors.
